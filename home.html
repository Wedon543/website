   Monitoring Current Food Security in Kenya using GIS 
        
    </p>
    
    <p>
        
        GIS analysis of food availability in a small area is done by monitoring land cover changes and local food environments to visualize potential threats over time and plan accordingly.
        
        </p>
    
    <p>
        
        On a larger scale, leveraging GIS technologies to analyse satellite imagery helps track climate changes, monitor rainfall and keep tabs on soil fertility to reveal potential for food shortages in a given area.
    
    </p>
    
    <p> GIS is a tool of growing importance in the efforts to better understand relationship between food availability, agricultural lands and the effect of climate change on agricultural production. This improves sustainable practices and to adequately plan for threats on food security.
